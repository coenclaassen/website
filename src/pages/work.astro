    <h5 class="bold spacer-8">Most ideas don't fail in the market. <span class="thin">They fail much earlier.</span></h5>
    
    <p class="post-h3 thin spacer-4">In the phase where ideas are still fragile. Where decisions are tightly coupled. And where momentum is hardest to find. That's where I work.</p>

        <ul class="p-grid thin">
          <li>There's no roadmap yet</li>
          <li>The idea feels too early, risky, or undefined.</li>
          <li>Teams are stuck debating instead of building</li>
          <li>Technical, design, and business decisions are tightly coupled.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p-grid thin">If execution feels easy already, you probably don't need me.</p>

        <p class="p-grid thin">I help teams move from uncertainty to momentum.</p>
        <p class="p-grid thin">That usually means:</p>
        <ul class="p-grid thin">
          <li>Framing the problem so it can be acted on</li>
          <li>Identifying the few things that must be proven early</li>
          <li>Turning abstract questions into tangible prototypes</li>
          <li>Rallying a team to build with me</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p-grid thin">Prototypes are not deliverables.</p>
        <p class="p-grid thin">They're tools to think, align, and decide.</p>

      <div class="toggle-content spacer-2" id="toggle-3" style="display: none;">
        <p class="p-grid thin">Depending on the situation, I work in different roles:</p>
        <ul class="p-grid thin">
          <li>Sparring partner – early exploration, framing, and decision-making</li>
          <li>Hands-on builder – designing and shaping critical prototypes</li>
          <li>Embedded product lead – driving zero-to-one execution with the team</li>

        <p class="p-grid thin">The intent is always to move things forward.</p>

      </button>
      <div class="toggle-content spacer-2" id="toggle-4" style="display: none;">
        <ul class="p-grid thin">
          <li>Clear decisions instead of open-ended discussions</li>

          <li>Faster alignment across disciplines</li>
          <li>Momentum where things were previously stuck</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p-grid thin">This is not about rushing.</p>
        <p class="p-grid thin">It's about making the right decisions early – when they matter most.</p>
