I don't expect many people to read this, but if you're here — hi 👋

This probably isn't the most exciting repository. It's the code for my personal website:  
https://www.coenclaassen.com

I'm a product builder who turns early and uncertain ideas into real, shippable products.  
Most of my work lives where ambiguity is high, constraints are real, and momentum matters.

I use this site (and this code) to think in public about that work. It's a mix of:
- How I work and make decisions under uncertainty  
- Curiosity Coffee, a series of conversations with people building interesting things  
- Small experiments from learning in public  

About the code:
- Built with Astro  
- Partly written by me, partly with the help of Cursor AI
